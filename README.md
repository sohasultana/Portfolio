# Let's find Dinner
Timeframe: September 2023 - December 2023
Your role: Full Stack Developer
Tools: HTML, CSS, React, Javascript, Github
About the Project: 
This project connected users to local food banks in the Seattle area. The app consists of four main sections. The first section is the about page, which goes over the purpose of the app and its services. The next section is the profile section, in which users are able to create a profile. The purpose of the profile is for two reasons: for users who would like to volunteer at a food bank, and for users who would like to use the foodbank services. Creating a profile makes it easier for the foodbanks to keep track of all the users who are at the food bank. In addition, there is a find-a-foodbank section where users can filter through a foodbank to match their preferences. After, the last section is a volunteer form, where users can sign up to be a volunteer. 

 

Deliverables: 
The deliverable I was responsible for was creating the volunteer form for the users. I used HTML and javascript to create the different form sections. The sections included the user’s name, age, zip code, and contact information. In addition, I used Javascript to implement validation protocols such as only letting users who are older than 13 volunteer and making sure users are entering the correct format when providing their email and phone number.

Step by Step Outline:
Coming up with a Project Topic Proposal
Creating a Static-Mock Up (only an HTML and CSS outline)
Adding validation protocols with JavaScript
Creating the interactive features of the app using React
Creating an Ajax Firebase to store user data
Deploying the App to Github
