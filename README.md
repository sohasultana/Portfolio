## Deliverables
I was responsible for creating the volunteer form for the users. This included:
- Using **HTML** and **JavaScript** to create different form sections (name, age, zip code, contact information).
- Implementing validation protocols with **JavaScript** to ensure:
  - Only users older than 13 can volunteer.
  - Correct format for email and phone number.

## Step by Step Outline
1. **Coming up with a Project Topic Proposal**
2. **Creating a Static Mock-Up** (HTML and CSS outline)
3. **Adding Validation Protocols** with JavaScript
4. **Creating Interactive Features** using React
5. **Creating an Ajax Firebase** to store user data
6. **Deploying the App** to GitHub
